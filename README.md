# Project Summary

The goal of this project is to provide San Antonio Southeast Urban Deanery (SEUD) parish priests an idea of what their neighborhoods currently look like so that they can better understand their audience and find ways to invite and encourage Mass attendance, ministry participation, and grow the parish community. This can help SEUD parishes focus/grow/develop services and ministries that will provide for the needs of the people within their boundaries.

# Initial Questions

- What are some of the demographics (age, ethnicity, incomes, education, religion, other) within the SEUD?
- What are the housing trends within the SEUD geography (e.g., who is moving in  or out, single family units vs multi-housing, subsidized vs market rates)?
- What types of community services are being utilized by individuals/families (e.g., Food bank, Public vs Charter vs Private/Faith-based schools)?
- Does pre- vs post-pandemic data look very different (does it matter or are there any significant implications)?
